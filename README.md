# About the project

URLs are lossy compression of the application state. I don't know where I have first seen this. It feels really cool to be able to access the application at some particular, useful place. This isn't easily possible in native apps. This enables you to share things that wouldn't be possible to share, just with a text snippet.

Many apps allow you to configure such patterns to supercharge your productivity:

- [Project Bookmarks](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1228725/interesting-links?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) for Jira with configurable searches
- [Alfred](https://twitter.com/alfredapp) - boosts your efficiency with hotkeys, keywords, text expansion and more.

# Contributing

Create an issue or a pull request to add a new pattern.

# Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Patterns are in the `patterns` directory. Copy and edit `_empty.json` file to add a new pattern.
